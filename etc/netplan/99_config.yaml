# Note 1:
#   It is highly recommended to perform "sudo netplan try" before the actual application.
#
# Note 2:
#   Note that previous changes sometimes remain even if new ones are applied.
#
# Note 3:
#   Sometimes "sudo netplan try" doesn't revert changes for some reason,
#   but they should be reverted if you reboot the system because the Git diff is restored
#   when the system starts up.
